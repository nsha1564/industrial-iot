Industrial Iot Solution using Microservices Architecture

## Industrial IoT Monitoring System
The goal of this project is to build a microservices-based system that monitors industrial machines and sensors to predict failures, optimize performance, and manage maintenance schedules. Below is a detailed breakdown of the microservices required for this system:

### 1. Sensor Data Collection Service
**Purpose:** Collects data from various sensors deployed in the field.
**Responsibilities:**
- Communicate with IoT devices to gather sensor data (temperature, pressure, vibration, etc.).
- Ensure data is collected in real-time or at scheduled intervals.
- Store raw sensor data in a database or forward it to a message broker for further processing.
**Key Components:**
- REST API endpoints or MQTT brokers to receive data from sensors.
- Integration with databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or NoSQL databases like MongoDB for raw data storage.
- Data validation and filtering mechanisms.

### 2. Data Processing Service
**Purpose:** Processes raw sensor data to detect anomalies and identify potential issues.
**Responsibilities:**
- Consume data from the Sensor Data Collection Service via a message broker (like Kafka or RabbitMQ).
- Perform real-time data processing to identify anomalies using predefined rules or machine learning models.
- Send processed data and alerts to other services if anomalies are detected.
**Key Components:**
- Data consumers that read from the message broker.
- Real-time data processing frameworks like Apache Flink or Spring Cloud Stream.
- Integration with machine learning models for predictive analytics.

### 3. Alerting Service
**Purpose:** Sends alerts when specific conditions are met, such as a potential equipment failure or safety hazard.
**Responsibilities:**
- Listen for alerts or notifications from the Data Processing Service.
- Categorize alerts based on severity and importance.
- Notify relevant stakeholders (via email, SMS, or push notifications) based on alert rules.
**Key Components:**
- A rules engine to manage alerting criteria.
- Integration with communication services (Twilio for SMS, SMTP servers for email, etc.).
- A user interface to manage alert settings and view alert history.

### 4. Maintenance Scheduling Service
**Purpose:** Schedules and tracks maintenance activities based on predictive analytics and historical data.
Responsibilities:
- Monitor equipment status and performance metrics to predict when maintenance is required.
- Automatically schedule maintenance based on equipment conditions, minimizing downtime.
- Provide a dashboard for maintenance teams to view scheduled activities and log completed work.
**Key Components:**
- A scheduling engine to manage maintenance timelines and resource allocation.
- Integration with a calendar or workflow management system (like Google Calendar or custom solutions).
- REST APIs for integration with other services and user interfaces.

### 5. Reporting Service
**Purpose:** Generates reports on equipment performance, maintenance history, and system alerts.
**Responsibilities:**
- Aggregate data from various microservices (Sensor Data Collection, Data Processing, Maintenance Scheduling).
- Generate periodic reports (daily, weekly, monthly) on system performance and health.
- Provide an API for other services or external systems to request reports.
**Key Components:**
- Data aggregation and processing logic.
- Reporting tools (like JasperReports or custom-built solutions).
- A front-end UI or API endpoints for report generation and download.

### 6. User Management Service
**Purpose:** Manages users, roles, and access control for the entire system.
**Responsibilities:**
- Provide authentication and authorization services for all microservices.
- Manage user roles and permissions for accessing different parts of the system (e.g., admin, maintenance team, observer).
- Ensure secure access to data and functionalities based on user roles.
**Key Components:**
- Integration with OAuth2 or OpenID Connect for authentication (Spring Security).
- User and role management APIs.
- Secure communication and data protection mechanisms.

### 7. Device Management Service
**Purpose:** Manages the inventory and status of all connected devices (sensors, machines, etc.).
**Responsibilities:**
- Keep track of all registered devices and their current status (online, offline, malfunctioning).
- Provide APIs for device registration, status updates, and device configuration.
- Monitor device health and connectivity.
**Key Components:**
- Device registry database to store device metadata and status.
- REST APIs for device management.
- Integration with monitoring tools to check device health and connectivity.

## Architecture Considerations
- **Service Communication:** Use a combination of REST APIs for synchronous communication and message brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication.
- **Service Discovery:** Utilize Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka for service discovery and load balancing.
- **Configuration Management:** Use Spring Cloud Config or HashiCorp Consul for managing configuration across services.
- **Security:** Implement security best practices using Spring Security, OAuth2, and JWT tokens for securing microservices.
**Observability:** Implement logging (using tools like ELK Stack), monitoring (using Prometheus and Grafana), and tracing (using Zipkin or Jaeger) to ensure system observability.
